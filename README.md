debian-backports cookbook
=========================

Just a bit of a warning. If you are a household wife and landed here
for some yummy recipes, you might want to learn that you ventured
too far in the wast lands of the Internet. Also, for all you perverts
out there, backports do not mean what you would like to.

Ok, with that out of the way, we can proceed to what this cookbook is
about. Which I will write down later, when I finish first usable version
of it.
